	<h5>There are some glaring problems with our ability to track down some facts when searching for news. This website has been created in an attempt to restore some purity that true journalism has lost. Reporters have died to bring us the truth, yet we allow 'the man' to bury it all beneath a mountain of pointed lies and shiney distractions.</h5>

	<h5>The line between complaint and action</h5>
	<p>I have witnessed fathoms more people quick to enumerate the list of things wrong with this world, but just a sliver willing to take responsibility for what its become. Many within the former group undoubtedly possess charitible hearts. They appear to fall victim to any number of aggressors from social pressures & ignorance to denial. I can't help but blame the obscurity of relevant, accurate information to even those eagerly in search of it. </p>
	<p>I can give you one pretty good example from last year. A young lady had attracted the attention of some television producers through her unique approach to community service. They wanted to film her good deeds in action and asked her to generate a local project to help the homeless.</p>
	<p>She brainstormed for nearly a month until she came up with and idea to write positive affirmations all over some stuffed teddy bears. The concept was to have the homeless people return to their camps and have positive messages to combat the depression many of them are plagued with.</p>
	<p>You may say to me, "what's the big deal? Sounds kind enough." Then I can continue by explaining to you that these teddy bears are over 3 feet in height.In essence, the film crew of a national television station and a large group of volunteers spent all day distributing these giant bears to people with very real needs. Then they finished their task and disappeared from the limelight, never having made a difference despite all their efforts.</p>
	<p>Most of these teddybears were discarded immediately and many more had no desire to be seen on national television clad in the latest rags and stains. These people are focused on their basic needs and a teddybear is just one giant burden to carry along with the rest of their possessions.</p>
	<p>What I gathered from the whole thing was that we live in a world where we are taught that our feelings and perceptions of reality are more important than reality itself.</p>

	<h5>Its the same everywhere</h5>
	<p>My local news reports meaningless garbage in the mornings. One hour of adopt a pet, finest wines of the year, celebrity fashion, etc. The nightly news is basically a summary of what happened on foxnews and cnn. Lately, even PBS has sunk to the same level as all the rest. All the rest ends up back to belonging to about 3 people so theres little hope there.</p>
	<p>The talk radio programs have so  little support they're forced to advertise so many products they run out of time to discuss the issues. If their opinions hit too close to home they are character assassinated to death.</p>
	<p>I have to watch alzeera english and russia today just to find out whats going on in the us.</p>
	<p>One can't help but wonder for a moment if there just isn't a ton of bad news going on locally. Its not the case. In the unreported local news we've had political turmoil, law changes, murders, kidnappings, coorporate takeover, infrastructure design builds, school schedule changes, vaccinations, and countless more. When I travel and pop on their local news for contrast I see more of the same. Let's unite and let these filthy puppets know we demand more.</p>

	<h5>Who pays their bills? We do!</h5>
	<p>Back to the matter of personal responsibilty, I am a believer in the ability for one person to make a huge difference. After all, people do it all the time. We saw that in Las Vegas when one man decided to shoot into a crowd of people. Don't think he made a difference just ask the family members of the deceased, or the shareholders for the Mandalay Bay. If a single man can create a disaster couldn't one person make a little piece of the world shine?</p>
	<p>Well what's required? That's the hard part. In my sociology class we discussed the ways we can make changes in daily life. One example was taking the knowledge of Walmart's anti-human practices and our financial woes and still making a decision to shop somewhere else so that we apply actual action to our knowledge. Much of the 'conspiracy theories' surrounding corporate greed can be obtained legally by any member of the public. Don't take my word for it, find out for yourself. Matter of fact we would love to see it too so please post your findings for others to use. Leave a comment about how the information was legally obtained so others can verify and maybe motivate themselves to change a couple things too.</p>

	<h5>With so many sources reporting their opinions about intentionally distracting 'headliners', where are we to turn for truth?</h5>
	<p>It used to be that I could bypass the irrelevant news stories delivered to me on the tele by simply taking the extra time to read through the newspaper.</p>
	<p>These days, even when I pick that up, I can feel the agendas of others aggressively being pushed on me. I read through a few paragraphs, a set of factual statements that exist independent of any opinions. Often the conclusions to these articles will present conclusions they claim self-evident. At times I have difficulty pulling out any relational threads from their opinions to the facts.</p>
	<p>As for me, I would rather be told the facts, plain and simple, and then be allowed to formulate what conclusions I may. After all, it isn't really my opinion if you told me what to think,  is it?</p>
